# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows logged in users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).

TinyApp will return a personalize list of shortened URLS for each user. The user can make new short URLS, delete their existing short URLS or edit their URLs to get a different randomly generated TinyApp id.

Users' passwords are stored with bcrypt and their cookies are encrypted with cookie-session.
